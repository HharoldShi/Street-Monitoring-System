# Street-Monitoring-System
Demonstrated an optimized traffic system to help local police install security cameras at traffic intersections. 
## Inter-process-communication
Implemented inter-process-communication between three process random-street-gen, graph-gen and shortest-path-finder. 
## Min-Vertex-Cover
The project is to construct an optimized traffic system to help the local police install security cameras at traffic intersections. The idea is to minimize the number of cameras to install, while being as effective as possible with monitoring. The street maps are converted into undirected graphs, and the problem is reduced to solve the minimum vertex cover problem.
