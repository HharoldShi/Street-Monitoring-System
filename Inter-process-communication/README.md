# Inter-process-communication
The three process random-street-gen, graph-gen and shortest-path-finder are linked by the driver. Process random-street-gen generate radom streets specifications to be inputed to graph-gen. Process graph-gen then generate a graph, which is inputed into the shortest-path-finder to output shortest path between any two locations.
